# Python-correlation-analysis
In this Repository, I aim to find the pattern within the data and the correlations that happen to be between variables to assess what variables affect the `gross` variable.

## Findings:

After all of the analysis has been done here, I have found that there's a high correlation between `gross` and `budget`, r=0.75. Further, we might consider the `votes` variable as postively correlated with `gross` income, with r=0.63.
